_*actually it ended up costing quite a bit more than that_

# How We Got Here (Prelude)
A few years ago I refurbished a T440S for my girlfriend and gave it to her for school. At the time, I had set it up as a Mojave Hackintosh with Clover. Fast-forward a few years and she eventually purchased a new M1 MacBook Pro (since she needed an _actual_ Mac for work that would be a lot more reliable than something pasted together with glue and config files). Understandable. Realizing she didn't need it anymore, I figured I would take the T440S and mess with it some more. 

So now I had another toy to mess with. Not realizing the immediate limitations of the T440S (non-socketed CPU, internal battery, low res screen, clunkpad, etc), I started ordering some parts. 

The first thing I swapped out was the (apparently) well-hated "Clunkpad". This was a bit of a bitch to get taken care of (and was no different on the T440P, either), but was overall worth it. The original trackpad kind of sucks and has softer, almost scissor-key like switches arranged in a 2x2 grid instead of a traditional clicking mechanism. The actual right/left click buttons were now more just "zones" that really did not feel satisfying to use. Even with the TrackPoint still being present, the lack of those physical buttons on the top of the trackpad as well meant it just felt really gross to use no matter how you wanted to use it.

Clunkpad replaced, I figured I would toss in a M2. SATA SSD and install a fresh copy Arch Linux onto it. This was _kind_ of a disaster in of itself. I ended up ordering a "KingShark *GAMING* SSD" for $70 since it had pretty favorable reviews and was a compatible with the M2 SATA 2240 slot inside the T440S. After attempting and failing to install Arch from scratch using the `archinstall` command, I moved on to EndevourOS which more or less worked. At some point, I decided I wanted to try BRTFS as the file system, and for _some reason_ the whole DRIVE went tits up after that. The BIOS no longer saw the SSD at all and only spat out an error about the drive being un-usable. Chalking it up to maybe a bad drive, I ordered a replacement off Amazon and tried again only for the same issue to happen. At this point, I decided to forget about the drive, but in doing research to fix the problems of the T440S, seeing artciles and videos on the T440P... _really_ caught my eye. The way I saw it, the T440P just had so much _more_ fiddling potential.

Pretty much scrapping the stuff I had done with the T440S entirely, I put the original clunkpad back in it, installed Windows 10 pro and gave it to a family member to worry about. 
A day or so on eBay and I saw **the listing**. The _ultimate_ listing. No display, no keyboard, no HDD, no RAM. Sold AS-IS with a broken display. $49 + $20 shipping, "Buy It Now". The perfect project laptop for me to waste the next few weeks on. **Sold**. 

# Nothing Goes According To Plan (Part I)
To get the show started for my new T440P, I went ahead and ordered some replacement parts that I knew I would need based on the eBay listing. I used the _excellent_ Octoperf guide about the T440P [here](https://octoperf.com/blog/2018/11/07/thinkpad-t440p-buyers-guide) along with the convenient Lenovo Hardware Manual and FRU list to source things. Among the first batch of things was a 1080P replacement panel (I decided to go with the N140HCE-EN1 Rev. C2 due to its lower power consuption), an 8GB stick of DDR3L RAM, and a backlit English keyboard (Made by Chicony; FRU 04x0139). I wanted to add a few additional things such as USB-C charging, an upgraded processor, and a battery, so I went ahead and ordered those items as well. 

Few days pass and the parts start trickling in, first with the new display and keyboard, finally followed by the unit itself. Despite such a low asking price and the missing parts, it was in decent enough shape. No major scratches or scuffs on the housing, no chipped or peeling coatings, and all of the screws and internal stuff was in-tact (aside from the HDD caddy). Time to get to work!

After replacing the display, installing the new RAM and SSD (instead of the KingShark Gaming drive, I went with a more well-known brand and got a Transcend 256GB drive instead. I also ditched the idea of doing anything BTRFS related for the time being) and seating the new keyboard I fired the machine on for the first time and got... _5 beeps_... This... Was not good. I knew this was not good. 5 Beeps? _5 beeps?_ The lights on the keyboard and power button would come on no problem, and even the CPU fan kicked on after a bit, but I was getting absoutely _nothing_ on the display. I tried a few things at first, mostly just re-seating the RAM and SSD. Trying the other slot for the RAM, without the SSD entirely, then eventually with neither to see if the beep-code would change. Nada. 

I did some digging and got worried pretty quickly. 5 beeps, according to all the threads I found and even Lenovo's documentation, pointed towards an issue with the motherboard. I felt immediately defeated before any of the real fun even began. I told myself it was no big deal since I didn't spend a whole lot on it yet _anyways_, but I still felt dumb for buying something I couldn't guarantee worked in the first place. 

I thought of a few solutions that could fix the issue without confronting the idea that the motherboard was toast entirely just yet. I ordered a replacement CMOS battery and main battery off Amazon. After installing the CMOS battery, I looked up ways to possibly try and get a signal from the laptop, but didn't have much luck. I thought about maybe trying to recover the BIOS using something like "WINCRISIS", but any attempts at that I saw online were vague and out-dated, usually ending in the original poster saying they either couldn't get it working or that they just gave up all together. At this point, I had only tried getting a VGA signal out of the laptop and didn't have any mini-display port adapters on hand to try. Given that I didn't get any signal through VGA, I ditched the idea of an external display and resumed just trying to get any signal at all on the replacement panel. My next options were becoming increasingly clear; either get a replacement motherboard, a new CPU (I saw some threads saying a bad CPU would also cause 5 beeps) or try to recover the BIOS using an external flasher. I went with all three.

# Recovering the BIOS
Now in the past, I had modified the BIOS of that T440S to allow for non-whitelisted Lenovo wireless cards. This was intentionally so I could set up MacOS on it. I recall the process being a bit dodgy... Pretty much I had to dump the BIOS using an external programmer (I used a CH341a) and send it to a guy through a BIOS modding forum to get it taken care of. It wasn't the most legit way to do things, but the site was discussed a lot and plenty of people were in the same thread with success stories, so I went ahead and PM'ed the fellow. Got my modified BIOS probably not even 30 minutes later and proceeded to flash. It worked and I sent the guy a tip via PayPal for his services. 

Fast forward to now, apparently BIOS Modding for things like whitelist removal has become well documented and doable to just about anyone with an external flasher. Not knowing whether or not the BIOS was corrupted with my motherboard, I attempted to dump it using another ThinkPad (my trusty little X230 that I modded a few years ago). Problem is, the CH341a flasher worked, but the little clips I had to dump the BIOS chip had become quite lose and weren't getting a solid enough connection to the chip. Multiple, frustrating attempts at getting the chip to read in both Windows and Linux proved unsuccessful.
