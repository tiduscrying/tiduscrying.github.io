_*actually it ended up costing quite a bit more than that_

# Why?
Because... I could, I guess. I originally had and gave a T440S to my girlfriend as a school laptop. This was a few years ago and she has since replaced it with an M1 MacBook Pro, so she ended up giving it back to me. At the time, I had set it up as a Mojave Hackintosh with Clover, but she needed an _actual_ Mac for work that would be a lot more reliable than something pasted together with glue and config files. Understandable. 

So now I had another toy to mess with. Not realizing the immediate limitations of the T440S (non-socketed CPU, internal battery, low res screen, clunkpad, etc), I started ordering some parts.
