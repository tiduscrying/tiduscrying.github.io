_*actually it ended up costing quite a bit more than that_

# Why?
Because... I could, I guess. A few years ago I refurbished a T440S for my girlfriend and gave it to her for school. At the time, I had set it up as a Mojave Hackintosh with Clover. Fast-forward a few years and she eventually purchased a new M1 MacBook Pro (since she needed an _actual_ Mac for work that would be a lot more reliable than something pasted together with glue and config files). Understandable. Realizing she didn't need it anymore, I figured I would take the T440S and mess with it some more. 

So now I had another toy to mess with. Not realizing the immediate limitations of the T440S (non-socketed CPU, internal battery, low res screen, clunkpad, etc), I started ordering some parts. 

The first thing I swapped out was the (apparently) well-hated "Clunkpad". This was a bit of a bitch to get taken care of (and was no different on the T440P, either), but was overall worth it. The original trackpad kind of sucks and has softer, almost scissor-key like switches arranged in a 2x2 grid instead of a traditional clicking mechanism. The actual right/left click buttons were now more just "zones" that really did not feel satisfying to use. Even with the TrackPoint still being present, the lack of those physical buttons on the top of the trackpad as well meant it just felt really gross to use no matter how you wanted to use it.

Clunkpad replaced, I figured I would toss in a M2. SATA SSD and install a fresh copy Arch Linux onto it. This was _kind_ of a disaster in of itself. I ended up ordering a "KingShark *GAMING* SSD" for $70 since it had pretty favorable reviews and was a compatible with the M2 SATA 2240 slot inside the T440S. After attempting and failing to install Arch from scratch using the `archinstall` command, I moved on to EndevourOS which more or less worked. At some point, I decided I wanted to try BRTFS as the file system, and for _some reason_ the whole DRIVE went tits up after that. The BIOS no longer saw the SSD at all and only spat out an error about the drive being un-usable. Chalking it up to maybe a bad drive, I ordered a replacement off Amazon and tried again only for the same issue to happen. At this point, I decided to forget about the drive, but in doing research to fix the problems of the T440S, seeing artciles and videos on the T440P... _really_ caught my eye. The way I saw it, the T440P just had so much _more_ fiddling potential. Open BIOS modding, well documented 

Pretty much scrapping the stuff I had done with the T440S entirely, I put the original clunkpad back in it, installed Windows 10 pro and gave it to a family member to worry about. 
A day or so on eBay and I saw **the listing**. The _ultimate_ listing. No display, no keyboard, no HDD, no RAM. Sold AS-IS with a broken display. $45 + $20 shipping, "Buy It Now". **Sold**.
