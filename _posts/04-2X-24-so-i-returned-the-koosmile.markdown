#Yeah...
So about that Koosmile Laptop, ya'know, the  "Mini Laptop,8 inch HD Touch Screen Mini Computer Windows 11 Pro, Intel N100 4 cores 2-in-1 Pocket PC 12GB LPDDR5 RAM 512GB M.2 SSD, Gigibit | Wi-fi 6 | BT5.2 | 2MP Camera | G-Sensor | HDMI". that I wrote about semi-recently. We had our good times! Great battery, decent display, nice hefty weight to it... I replaced the SSD, that was great. Got some good speeds out of that. Could never get Linux running on it! But that's okay! Windows on a small device was novel enough to justify that thing, right? 

I fucking hated the USB-A port being upside down. 

I've said it before, I'll continue saying it -- I am a crazy person. Call it OCD, call it ADHD, call it _whatever_, I am certifiably crazy and the tinies little mundane things become dealbreakers for me. For the Koosmile, it was the USB-A port being upside down. 

See, the main justification for that thing that I told people about was all the _utility_ I'd be able to squeeze out of it. Think about flashing BIOSes! Using a digital microscope! Pentesting! Or something! My main, actual use-case was the BIOS flashing, and I quickly realized that an upside-down USB-A port totally pissed in the punch for my CH341a flasher. The business end for the flasher is up top, meaning I'd have to orient the Koosmile in kind of a funny way (or rotate it) to still get to the action-y bits of the flasher and still somewhat use the laptop. 

The keyboard was also not stellar, and no matter how much I tried to get better at using it, I couldn't really ever break 30wpm, which is _awful_ for me (I average between 100-110wpm on a standard keyboard). 

So I debated returning the thing all together or looking for a different device entirely. I mentioned the GPD MicroPC in my previous post and I was truly drawn to it, but decided against it since it would be a significant performance hit versus the Koosmile while maintaining the same $300-ish price point. Getting the GPD Pocket 3 would have been _kind_ of an option, but the inability to do 16GB of RAM with the Intel N6000 variant kinda bummed me out and soured that idea, _especially_ for upwards of $650. 

Another device caught my eye when I was initially looking at the Koosmile that I had initially dismissed due to the price -- the One Netbook A1 Pro. A revamp of the excitingly named One Netbook A1 (non-pro) from a few years prior, the A1 Pro is a similarly designed device compared to the GPD Pocket 3 meaning the port selection was comparitively excellent compared to the Koosmile. Offered in a few variants (i3, i5 and i7 with different storage options, but all with 16GB DDR4 RAM), the A1 Pro boasts a full sized Gigabit Ethernet port, micro HDMI (okay), microSD, USB-C/Thunderbolt, RS-232 _and_ two full sized USB-A ports **that are the right orientation**!

Yes, the A1 Pro is more expensive than the Koosmile by almost double the price. One Netbook lists the i3 model on its website for ~$500-$600 and it can be had off Aliexpress for just the same. It seemed like, possibly due to age, the A1 Pro's i5 and i7 variants weren't really available anywhere else. BUT, luckily, conveniently, bizarrely, I came across a listing on the US version of Mercari for the i5 variant (i5-1137g) complete-in-box for $450. I caved. 

After about a week, the A1 Pro arrived in shockingly good condition. The previous owner had said they were trying to lighten their load from projects and items they no longer used, but I wasn't expecting them to keep _everything_ in tact with the device. I'm talking the little foam/cloth piece covering the keyboard here, plus the original plastic on the device. 

The device is significantly lighter than the Koosmile was, and the display is about an inch smaller at 7 inches. That said, it's got an insanely high res panel (1920x1200) and a way more comfortable keyboard to type on. I was pretty pleased with the presentation right out of the box, but as with everything -- there were some issues. 

##The Cons
Jumping right into negatives? What's wrong with me? Yeah, I mean this thing _is_ good. I do like it, but there are some gripes I have with it that are pretty disappointing right off the bat. 
- It is _loud_. The single, tiny blower fan on the bottom of the laptop does a good job of keeping the A1 cool, but the fan sounds insane in doing so. Temps never peaked above 70C, which is pretty solid considering the power this thing packs in such a small footprint. There is a little fan button on the keyboard that lets you switch between the standard fan curve and an always-100% mode, but I always kept it in standard.
- The insides are... a bit frustrating. I was hoping to use the 2242 NVME drive I had purchased second hand for the Koosmile in the A1 Pro, but I wasn't 
able to. Disappointingly, the storage is soldered onto the motherboard. Luckily, it isn't eMMC storage or anything, it _does_ register as a PCIe Gen 4 drive, it's just bolted directly onto the board. This worries me in the sense that there is literally no repairability here, but the A1 can boot off of USB of course and shockingly microSD as well. Speeds for the drive aren't really that bad either.
